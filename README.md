This repository contains all the data that makes the launcher work!


## One Launcher, Multiple Games

Tired of downloading multiple games from different sources? Well with this launcher all my games are tied to it so no need to go looking for downloads, they are all kept tidy within the launcher!

## Boy, do I hate signing in.

Me too, within the launcher you are able to sign in to your GameJolt account using your Username and Token **(Your token is NOT your password)** and whenever you launch a game from within the launcher, if the game implements GameJolt API integrations, it will automatically log you in and you won't have to sign in to any of the games in the launcher!

## What's it written in?

Don't you want to know ;)

## Download games simultaneously

This launcher supports queuing games for install, you can choose to install 1 game or all the games, the launcher will do it all! __(As long as you don't close the launcher)__
